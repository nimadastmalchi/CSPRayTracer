A Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) system simulator that utilizes ray-tracing. Rays are generated toward an array of mirrors
which then reflect each toward a collector. The temperature and power outputs of the collector are calculated.

Running the program with different implemented functions outputs various files. When those data files are generated, the 
commands on top of main.cpp can be put in Gnuplot to visualize the ray tracer or plot the data calculated.
